  <h2>The public record for private settlements</h2>
  <p>Arbout is a crowd-sourced public database of arbitration outcomes. It aggregates search results to preserve the confidentiality of individual cases.</p>

  <h3>What is arbitration?</h3>
  <p>Arbitration is an alternative to suing in court.</p>
  <p>Unlike the court system, the arbitration system is run by private companies and doesn't enter its outcomes into the public record. Furthermore, some arbitration is confidential by design, which can shield the parties from the reputational risk of disputes, at the cost of leaving lawmakers and the public in the dark.</p>
  <p>Arbitration is increasingly relevant because many online services include binding arbitration clauses. These clauses can force customers to use arbitration rather than going to court.</p>

  <h3>How does Arbout work with private arbitration?</h3>
  <p>Arbout doesn't reveal the individual contents of your arbitration. It uses a method called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy">differential privacy</a> to only reveal information when many cases have similar outcomes.</p>
  <p>For example, if a company paid a settlement less than the disputed amount in 50 cases, Arbout would reveal that in aggregate. But we wouldn't show the individual amounts or cases.</p>
