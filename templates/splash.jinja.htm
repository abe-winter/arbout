    <h2>The arbitration outcomes database</h2>
    <p>Arbout is a crowd-sourced public database of arbitration outcomes.</p>

    <h3>What is arbitration?</h3>
    <p>Arbitration is an alternative to suing in court.</p>
    <p>Unlike the court system, the arbitration system is run by private companies and doesn't enter its outcomes into the public record. Furthermore, some arbitration is private by design, which can shield the parties from the reputational risk of disputes.</p>
    <p>Arbitration is increasingly relevant because many online services include binding arbitration provisions. That forces customers to use arbitration rather than going to court if the seller violates their agreement.</p>

    <h3>How does Arbout work with private arbitration?</h3>
    <p>Arbout doesn't reveal the individual contents of your arbitration. It uses a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy">differential privacy</a> to only reveal information when many cases have similar outcomes.</p>
    <p>For example, if a company paid a settlement less than the disputed amount in 50 cases, Arbout would reveal that in aggregate. But we wouldn't show the invidual amounts or cases.</p>

    <h3>How do I dispute the information in this database?</h3>
    <p>We have a robust <a href="/disputes">dispute process</a> and we are committed to the correctness of the aggregate information we serve.</p>
