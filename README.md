# Arbout

Arbout is a database & differential privacy search engine for arbitration outcomes.

There's a live server hosted at [arbout.org](https://arbout.org).

## Why differential privacy

Individual arbitration outcomes are often protected from disclosure by confidentiality rules, but there's a public policy interest in revealing these outcomes in aggregate. Differential privacy bridges this gap by providing search over aggregate trends while preventing disclosure of individual case details.
