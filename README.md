# Arbout

Arbout is a database & aggregate search engine for arbitration outcomes.

There's a live server hosted at [arbout.org](https://arbout.org).

## Why aggregate search

The arbout search engine doesn't return individual cases -- it only returns summaries when many cases against a single party have the same details.

Individual arbitration outcomes are often protected from disclosure by confidentiality rules, but there's a public policy interest in revealing these outcomes in aggregate.
